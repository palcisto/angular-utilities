# angular-utilities
Various Angular 1.x utility filters, services, and directives written with ES6.

## Project Status
Currently the unit tests pass, but I haven't had time to build out the example view and test the gulp configuration for the view, so there is no app to run. I created the `dateRange` filter in another project I was working on and just brought it over to this repo as I have few other utilities I plan to add, such as a truncate text directive.

## Contributing
Feel free to clone the repo, branch, and submit Pull Requests. Please make sure to write proper unit tests for any proposed features.
